A concurrent program consists of processes(atleast one thread per process) and shared objects.
A process is a sequential program executing on some processor; the shared objects are built
using shared memory or a computer-communication network.

Concurrent programs are often found in reactive systems - systems whose
outputs may affect their environment and, therefore; may influence subsequent
inputs. e.g. operating systems.

Correctness for a reactive system concerns initial, final, as well as intermediate states.

Two forms of synchronization are prevalent in concurrent programs. 

The first, mutual exclusion, involves grouping actions into critical sections and blocking execution of a
critical section in one process whenever a critical section from another has
started but not completed. 
Mutual exclusion ensures that a state resulting from
execution of only part of a critical section is never visible to another process.

The second form, condition synchronization, blocks a process until the system
state satisfies some specified condition. This is useful for ordering events that
occur at different processes.

Propositional logic in concurrent programs.
(Zeroth-order and first-order logic)

Correctness means that certain desirable program properties hold. In the
case of sequential programs, where a control resides at each moment in only
one point, these properties usually are:

1. Partial correctness, that is, whenever a result is delivered it is correct
w.r.t. the task to be solved by the program. For example, upon termi-
nation of a sorting program, the input should indeed be sorted. Partial
means that the program is not guaranteed to terminate and thus deliver
a result at all.
2. Termination. For example, a sorting program should always terminate.
3. Absence of failures. For example, there should be no division by zero and
no overflow.
In the case of concurrent programs, where control can reside at the same
time in several control points, the above properties are much more difficult
to establish. Moreover, as observed before, we are then also interested in
establishing

establishing:

4. Interference-freedom, that is, no component of a parallel program can
manipulate in an undesirable way the variables shared with another com-
ponent.
5. Deadlock-freedom, that is, a parallel program does not end up in a situ-
ation where all nonterminated components are waiting indefinitely for a
condition to become true.
6. Correctness under the fairness assumption.

Extension of logic - known as temporal logic - is a way to analyze the temporal properties of concurrent programs like the order in which the instructions of a program must happen, rather than just the input/output relationship.

Temporal logic allows specifying and proving the temporal properties of a program interest to us:

Safety properties: Asserts that the program does not do something bad.
Liveness properties: Asserts that the program does eventually do something good.

e.g:
Partial correctness, mutual exclusion and deadlock-freedom are safety properties.
Termination and starvation-freedom are liveness properties.

e.g:
Assuming that angle bracketed expressions( <...> ) are atomic operations:
S1: 
{
    <x = x + 1;>
}
S2: 
{
    <x = x + y + 1;>
    <x = x - y;>
}

Statements S1 and S2 produce same mapping from initial to final states, as such they are equivalent in sequential execution of a program.

However consider the following concurrent program where cobegin and coend mark the clauses which are executed concurrently:

cobegin
S3:
{
    <y = y - 7;>
} 
S:
{
    ?
}
coend

Substituting S1 for S yields a program that increments x by one, while substituting S2 for S yields a program that increments x by either one or eight 
- the latter occuring if the statement S1: { y = y - 7 } is executed between the execution of the two statements of S2.

Hence S1 and S2 are not equivalent operations when appearing in concurrent execution.

x = x + y + 1;
y = y - 7;
x = x - y

x = (x + y + 1) - (y - 7)
x = (x + y + 1) - y + 7
x = x + y + 1 - y + 7
x = x + 1 + 7
x = x + 8


As such we cannot restrict our attention to what is true before and after the execution of a concurrent program; we must also consider what happens during its execution.

wp(x := x + y + 1; y := y - 7; 'x := x - y, 'x = x + 8)

= 
= wp(x = x + y + 1; y = y - 7, x - y = x + 8)
= wp(x = x + y + 1, x - (y - 7) = x + 8) 
= wp(x - (y - 7) = x + 8) 
= 
= wp((x + y + 1) - (y - 7) = (x + y + 1) + 8) 
= 
= wp((x + y + 1) - (-1 - 7) = (x + y + 1) + 8) 
= 
= wp(- (-1 - 7) = 8) 
= wp(1 + 7 = 8) 
= wp(1 + 7 = 8) 
= wp(8 = 8) 
= 
= T
